# Individual Portfolio

## What is a Developer Portfolio?
A Developer Portfolio is a website that showcases your skills, experience and work to prospective employers. It 
is similar in ways to a portfolio that an artist or photographer might create - they collate some example projects to 
show what sort of work they do. It's also a bit like a CV, as there will be aspects of talking about yourself and 
your background; but instead of just talking about your work, you can show what you've built!

## Why am I building one now?
- You will need a portfolio to find/get a job as it will help you to stand out.
- It is easier to build one now since the frontend course material will still be fresh on your minds.
- It is great practice for the skills you have been learning.
- This will also prepare you for when you gain access to Boolean's Career Services, as they can help you to refine 
  the portfolio.

## How do I make one?
The best way is to build one yourself! This way, even the portfolio site itself is a demonstration of your skills
and experience.

First, plan your portfolio! Do some research on designs, think about what content you want to include, structure the 
very high-level layout of the site, etc.

Next, build it! What you use to build it is up to you, and it will generally be one of: 
- A static website using just HTML, CSS and JS;
- A React Single Page App (SPA) - i.e. it has no routing;
- A React app with routing.

> At this stage, it is NOT advised to build something with a new language or framework. Save this for the projects 
> that you want to showcase in the portfolio!

In terms of the content to include, at a very high level, you will want to include:
- **Biography/Self-Intro** - a paragraph or two about you.
- **Tech Stack** - the languages/technologies that you have experience with.
- **Education / Experience** - only those that are relevant to coding / the line of work you want to go into.
- **Projects** - sites/apps that you have built.
  - Include a short description of what it does; the tech you used; and a link to the GitHub repo.
  - EITHER include a link to the deployed online version OR add screenshots, short clips, GIFs, etc.
  - Avoid including exercises from the course or apps built from tutorials.
  - Challenges from the course could be included as these involved less guidance but having something unique would 
    still be better to help you stand out from the crowd.
  - You will also have time to build and add more later!
